DDI is an HR services company that helps companies make better hiring decisions. They can offer anything from simple quizzes for front line workers to fully interactive mock work days for C level hiring. They use researched backed methods to help companies to describe the best candidates for a job and then testing to help find those candidates.

Interesting Fact: DDI is the company that developed behavioral interviewing. If you ask questions that start with "tell me about a time when" and try to get a STAR format answer back, you are using DDI methodologies.
