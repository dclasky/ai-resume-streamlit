Looking for Group (LFG) is a coworking and gaming space in Brookline, one of the neighborhoods of Pittsburgh. Founded in 2015 by John Lange and edd Batson, it has been the premiere, and often only, location in Pittsburgh for people to watch and play esports, video games, board games, and more. 

Looking for Group is also a tech entertainment events company, helping produce multiple events around the city. LFG helped ReplayFX, a 20,000 attendee retro arcade event at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center from 2016 through it's final show due to covid. LFG has also helped with Pittsburgh Gaming Expo, Carnegie Science Game Nights, Millvale Music Festival, and other events around the city, helping with tech, entertainment, and logistics.

Looking for Group also consults with local businesses and schools. Recently, LFG helped open The Rezzanine, an esports arena in Bridgeville. The Rezzanine has hosted large scale events with hundreds of attendees with the help of LFG and its connections in Pittsburgh.

If a gaming event is going to happen in Pittsburgh, LFG is often the go to company to assist with any part of the planning and execution.
