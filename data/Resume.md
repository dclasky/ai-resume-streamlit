Experience 

Rebellion Defense Feb 2023-June 2023 

Software Engineer 

Software engineer on the infrastructure team supporting teams that deliver products. Focused on mTLS infrastructure and support within a hostile zero-trust environment. Worked at upgrading SSL and mTLS infrastructure to decouple from AWS so products can be deployed in multiple environments, including non-AWS government cloud, on-premises, and in air-gapped networks. This work would allow customer environment time for creation to go from being measured in days to being measured in hours or minutes. Supported products were primarily written in Python and Go with Terraform, Docker, Make, and Docker-Compose for infrastructure as code. 

Academy Pittsburgh 2016-Current 

Director, Founder 

Co-Founder and Director of the first Pittsburgh coding boot camp, focusing on helping under-represented groups enter the tech workforce. Created state-licensed curriculum in back-end and front-end development, built partnerships with local foundations and companies, and successfully got more than 80% of graduating students a job in tech within a year of graduation. Contracted with local companies to give students real world experience and keep base tuition costs lower. Project manager and tech lead, guiding groups to successfully delivering dozens of products that have been used by tens of thousands of users, drastically reduced worker time through automation, and allowed multiple start-ups to gain hundreds of thousands in funding for further development based on MVPs produced by students. 

Key Projects 

- Taught and mentored more than 200 students, successfully helping them get jobs as developers, working with companies to find appropriate positions and with students to prepare them for interviews. This included instructional design for the classroom, building in students a strong understanding of a large range of topics from algorithms and data structures to database design to reactive programming design to front end design and development, and keeping students up on current developer trends. Students in my class had a greater than 90% graduation rate and more than 70% hire rate within 6 months of graduation, with an average salary increase of 20,000 per year. 
    

- Designed and built, with student teams, an event scheduling app that has been white labelled for multiple events per year in Pittsburgh and elsewhere. The backend is written in C# MVC and designed for non-technical users to create their own events and customize the app fully for their event. The front end is written in React Native with regular updates with AppCenter as the CI/CD pipeline. The app handles events with tens of thousands of users over a single day or weekend, allowing users to favorite upcoming acts and be notified when they should go to specific rooms and stages, with hundreds of thousands to millions of datapoints being recorded during a single event so event producers can have a live view of what is trending within the crowd. 
    
- Designed and managed students building a physical building security app that unlocks doors via phone app, using OAuth, MVC, React Native, and NodeJS along with physical relays, electronic locks, and microcontrollers. This is currently in place in a 22,000 square foot building with near 24 hours a day traffic and over 40 people with access without the need for physical keys or the possibility of the door being left unlocked accidentally. 
    
- Built and tested a Machine Learning / Image Recognition based app to help people with visual disabilities to play games with standard playing cards without requiring any special purchases of braille cards or altering of cards for people to play together. 
    

Looking for Group 2015-Current 

Founder, CTO 

Founder of a coworking and gaming space in Pittsburgh, PA that focuses on community building. Technology lead, designing and building systems to make sure all functionality is available for non-technical users. Built tooling for keeping PCs and servers up to date and secure, with the ability to automatically log into different gaming services via shared accounts. Consult with multiple local companies to build up events and event spaces, including a multi-year contract for designing and opening The Rezzanine as a secondary location in Pittsburgh. 

Key projects: 

- Created a full deployment system for deploying large scale LAN deployments at events which would allow a vendor to drop off more than 60 PCs and within one day, have them fully configured and ready to use for the event by a single person. This included OS provisioning, web filtering, game deployment, security updates, and more. Built using PXE/SFTP, PowerShell, C#, and Windows Deployment Services. This system drastically reduces setup hours for LAN areas by 80% or more. 
    
- Created a Gaming Launcher that runs on a local machine with permission to request username/passwords from a centralized location and launch a game on a given service and launching games. Front end runs on a webpage to allow for fully quick iteration on user interface and easy onboarding of new developers. Gives customers a familiar way to interact with the computer compared to similar software in the LAN center industry and leads to much higher visibility of games that are available to play and a much higher customer satisfaction than with competing software.

- Built OAuth connectors to LDAP/Active Directory via F5 to allow single sign on with client systems. 
    
- Designed a system and built a fully working proof of concept to move large scale legacy systems from a mix of virtual and physical on-premises servers to a PaaS cloud provider to allow for A/B testing and near zero downtime deployment without any changes to legacy code. 
    
- Planned and implemented the transition from Team Foundation Version Control to git, becoming a subject matter expert and working with teams and individuals to get buy-in and provide training and guidance. 
    
- Facilitated the architecture team in designing the change plan from a tightly coupled messaging-based system to a loosely coupled microservices architecture, making sure all SMEs contributed and that no functionality was lost or forgotten.

- Designed and created a time entry system to allow time tracking for over 1000 construction workers across dozens of jobs, allowing for real time job costing as hours were entered, vacation tracking for employees, creation of billable hours reports and reducing the clerical time required for weekly payroll using .NET and Crystal Reports. 
    
- Redesigned cross database transactional queries to allow efficient communication between database servers in low bandwidth, high latency situations by using debugging and tracing tools to find T-SQL bottlenecks. Took transactions between offices in China and the US from several minutes down to less than a second. 
    
- Designed and implemented a backup solution which decreased backup times from 10 hours of IT worker time to less than 30 minutes per week using no new hardware while reducing backup size and increasing data retention.
