Start:  2013
End: 2015
Years Active: 2013, 2014, 2015

Lead engineer in two teams, guiding both toward zero downtime by breaking down large, unwieldy monolith into a microservices architecture. Worked to improve the development culture with the introduction of pair programming, TDD, code reviews, user-centered design, and code craftsmanship. Provide expertise to the architecture team in infrastructure, SQL, and networking, reducing server costs and developer hours spent on rewrites. Designed and implemented automation strategies for deployment, working toward fully automated blue/green deployments. Designed and built custom functions into networking hardware and Windows servers for automated infrastructure deployment and building. Certified in behavioral interviewing and used as an expert interviewer by multiple teams for a range of technology jobs including systems administration, developer, and DBA candidates. 

Key projects: 

- Created VR UX elements and other object generics, from concept to code in Unity, for use with the VR headsets to provide an immersive experience for safety training in a virtual environment, which has now become a significant vertical within the company. 
    

- Built OAuth connectors to LDAP/Active Directory via F5 to allow single sign on with client systems. 
    
- Designed a system and built a fully working proof of concept to move large scale legacy systems from a mix of virtual and physical on-premises servers to a PaaS cloud provider to allow for A/B testing and near zero downtime deployment without any changes to legacy code. 
    
- Planned and implemented the transition from Team Foundation Version Control to git, becoming a subject matter expert and working with teams and individuals to get buy-in and provide training and guidance. 
    
- Facilitated the architecture team in designing the change plan from a tightly coupled messaging-based system to a loosely coupled microservices architecture, making sure all SMEs contributed and that no functionality was lost or forgotten. Researched and wrote architectural design documents on technologies and patterns, including RavensDB, RabbitMQ, SDN, CQRS, and microservices. 

* Created automation for SQL, SSL Certificates, OS installs and other items to reduce day to day workload on System Engineers to give more time for project work. Worked to bridge knowledge gap between the infrastructure/systems group and the development group to break down communication barriers by pairing with engineers and developers, attending design meetings for both teams, and making sure concerns from both sides were heard by the other. 

* Temporarily took over the Sr. DBA role when DBAs left to allow more time for a thorough candidate search and performed interviews for the position to find the right company fit. Reduced server communication noise, removing unnecessary alerts. Reduced alert thresholds for certain reports to help developer teams set attainable improvement goals, then worked with the development teams to reduce the number of long running procedures by more than 40%. Provided training and mentoring for the new DBAs, helping them transition into their role.
