Application/System Architect 2006-2012 

Reported directly to CIO with a management role in an international company with employees working in-office and remotely. Hired and managed a group developing in VB6, VB.NET, C# and SQL supporting accounting, project management and engineering management in engineering and construction environments. Designed and created solutions based on the needs of separate departments that benefited the company by understanding the needs of the entire business. Performed multiple company IT mergers after acquisitions, deployed solutions with 24x7 uptime, created redundancy and failover security in all locations, designed and implemented Exchange, SharePoint, Team Foundation Server, System Center, SQL, and other environments globally. Responsible for all IT purchasing and expense tracking. 

Key projects: 

- Designed and implemented changes to project tracking to account for changing currency exchange rates to allow Project Managers to be able to successfully forecast construction costs, even during the 2008 financial crisis when the Canadian dollar was stronger than the USD. This included code changes, training, and financial auditing approval, allowing the company to both drastically improve cashflow forecasting but also strategically allocate resources when dealing with a highly volatile financial market. 
    
- Planned and implemented the virtualization of the entire server environment without incurring unplanned downtime, allowing for a much smaller server footprint, faster and more reliable backups, and more flexibility in the system architecture. This project included building out a SAN storage environment, building multiple redundant networks and verifying that all systems were highly available. 
    

- Designed and implemented an invoice scanning, archiving and approving module to allow for complete electronic filing of all job-related expenses and job cost accountability. Designed for use on desktops and mobile devices including iOS devices and Android phones by using C# web services and an HTML5 compliant front end in 2009. 
    
- Designed and created a time entry system to allow time tracking for over 1000 construction workers across dozens of jobs, allowing for real time job costing as hours were entered, vacation tracking for employees, creation of billable hours reports and reducing the clerical time required for weekly payroll using .NET and Crystal Reports. 
    
- Redesigned cross database transactional queries to allow efficient communication between database servers in low bandwidth, high latency situations by using debugging and tracing tools to find T-SQL bottlenecks. Took transactions between offices in China and the US from several minutes down to less than a second. 
    
- Designed and implemented a backup solution which decreased backup times from 10 hours of IT worker time to less than 30 minutes per week using no new hardware while reducing backup size and increasing data retention.
