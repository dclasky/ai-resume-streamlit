Software engineer on the infrastructure team supporting teams that deliver products. Focused on mTLS infrastructure and support within a hostile zero-trust environment. Worked at upgrading SSL and mTLS infrastructure to decouple from AWS so products can be deployed in multiple environments, including non-AWS government cloud, on-premises, and in air-gapped networks. This work would allow customer environment time for creation to go from being measured in days to being measured in hours or minutes. Supported products were primarily written in Python and Go with Terraform, Docker, Make, and Docker-Compose for infrastructure as code.Â
