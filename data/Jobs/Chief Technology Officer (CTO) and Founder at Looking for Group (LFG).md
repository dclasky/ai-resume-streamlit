Founder of a coworking and gaming space in Pittsburgh, PA that focuses on community building. Technology lead, designing and building systems to make sure all functionality is available for non-technical users. Built tooling for keeping PCs and servers up to date and secure, with the ability to automatically log into different gaming services via shared accounts. Consult with multiple local companies to build up events and event spaces, including a multi-year contract for designing and opening The Rezzanine as a secondary location in Pittsburgh. 

Key projects: 

- Created a full deployment system for deploying large scale LAN deployments at events which would allow a vendor to drop off more than 60 PCs and within one day, have them fully configured and ready to use for the event by a single person. This included OS provisioning, web filtering, game deployment, security updates, and more. Built using PXE/SFTP, PowerShell, C#, and Windows Deployment Services. This system drastically reduces setup hours for LAN areas by 80% or more. 
    
- Created a Gaming Launcher that runs on a local machine with permission to request username/passwords from a centralized location and launch a game on a given service and launching games. Front end runs on a webpage to allow for fully quick iteration on user interface and easy onboarding of new developers. Gives customers a familiar way to interact with the computer compared to similar software in the LAN center industry and leads to much higher visibility of games that are available to play and a much higher customer satisfaction than with competing software.
